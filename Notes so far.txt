EM2040 dataset:
3 PCDs with identifiable objects so far, mostly moorings.
3 with unknown object classes, but clear objects
5 with no discernable object instances, or rough data.

EM2040 dataset from Summer coming next week.

Graph vs Euclidean representation for detection looking into.

Graph representation of PCDs:
Delaunay triangulation seems a simple and viable method, although somewhat computationally complex.

Graph operations --> Cluster into subgraphs --> classify subgraphs entirely

Clustering algorithms:
K-Means, or Bisected K-Means --> Extremely high performance, able to somewhat differentiate mooring chains from seafloor 
(but links them all to the same cluster).

DBSCAN/Birch work but havent under any tests been able to differentiate objects above seafloor level.

Graph-based methods, Affinity Propagation, Spectral clustering, and others are not scalable enough to work with large datasets,
would have to chunk pointclouds to an extreme level to be viable. Mostly due to the neighbour matrix metric used that had a quadratic
memory growth based on data size, 1000 points leads to 1000^2 dataframe for example.

RANSAC for linear approximation of seabed plane --> remove inliers --> profit.
